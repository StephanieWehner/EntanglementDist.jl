# Known distillation/filtering schemes

Compute how well several known entanglement distillation schemes perform on specific input states. We also implement a simple filtering scheme and provide function for computing the performance of general filtering schemes given the relevant measurement operators. The functions computing the choi states of said filtering protocols can be used to test the performance of the seesaw method.
